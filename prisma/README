TOPIC: AccountSecretReference.referenceId referential integrity
Each value in AccountSecretReferenceTargetType enum should correspond to a table of type Account*
For each record in AccountSecretReference, the referenceId should match a record from the Account* table.

Example:
For AccountSecretReferenceTargetType = "CRM", there is a corresponding AccountCRM table.
For a record in AccountSecretReference, for any record with referenceType = "CRM", referenceId MUST reference some record's PK from the Crm table.

TOPIC: Crm.configurationTemplate
This should be a JSON array of objects of the following schema:
fieldName: string, type: string, isSecret: boolean

For each object in the array with isSecret: true, the fieldName must be a value from the AccountSecretReferenceSecretType enum

TOPIC: ACCOUNT INTEGRATIONS
Every account integration (account*, e.g. accountCrm) record will have
many secretRefereces -> account*SecretReference (e.g. accountCrmSecretReference)
many eventProcesses -> account*EventProcess (e.g. accountCrmEventProcess)

There must be a system constraint capability, so that a specific reference to an integration can't use an inaccurate event process.

For example: In Nutshell, a lead can be created.  However, in crm x, there is no lead

So, there is an accompanying CrmIntegrationAction ()
