AccountCRM - should it include credentials?
That way the AccountCRM table doesn't get a ton of unused data

For example, in Nutshell maybe I need username/apikey
In Freshdesk, I need ... I dunno.  I dunno.

The way that OrderTarget works:
An orderTarget has a targetType.
Take, for example, targetType = CRM.
Then target externalHostId would be a CRM ID, from the CRM relation.
externalHostId should reference SOME record.
- If targetType is CRM, then externalHostId is a CRM.id

externalHostRecordType references some targetType recordType.
For example, if targetType is CRM, then externalHostRecordType is a CRMRecordType
