TOPIC: AccountSecretReference.referenceId referential integrity
Each value in AccountSecretReferenceTargetType enum should correspond to a table of type Account*
For each record in AccountSecretReference, the referenceId should match a record from the Account* table.

Example:
For AccountSecretReferenceTargetType = "CRM", there is a corresponding AccountCRM table.
For a record in AccountSecretReference, for any record with referenceType = "CRM", referenceId MUST reference some record's PK from the Crm table.
